As a part for End-Term Project for the course **EE 605: Error Correcting Codes** we accomplished the following 


* Performed an in-depth literature review to explore the construction and practical applications of Raptor codes
* Simulated practical digital message transmission by implementing Raptor code encoding and decoding schemes
from scratch, while modeling the Internet as a Binary Erasure Channel (BEC)
* Delivered a concise talk showcasing the significance of Raptor codes as a contemporary coding technique
